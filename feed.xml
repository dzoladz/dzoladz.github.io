Becker’s series <strong>Blank Topographies</strong> (2017–present) is currently on view at the <a href="https://wexarts.org/">Wexner Center for the Arts</a>. This work is a brilliant illustration of the process of exformation, the removal of signifiers from an object to make it less informative.</p> <p>Blank Topographies is a series of pre-formed topographic relief maps. Each map contains the most expensive mountain real estate in the year that it was created. The maps are painted to match the color of the display wall on which they are mounted, retaining only the relations of the topographic textures themselves. By removing the common markers of value (such as roads, location names, natural resources, and other cultural landmarks), the systems of symbolic value have been extracted from the landscape; thus, reducing the informative references of both the map and terrain.</p> <p><strong>Jonas N.T.

In particular, web frameworks and libraries using to facilitate full-stack application development. My day-to-day activities at OPLIN (Ohio Public Library Information Network) involve the creation, maintenance, and implementation of new features for a suite of custom applications that enable OPLIN’s internal workflows and processes in support of Ohio’s 251 public libraries. Here’s a set of applications that I’m excited to take with me into the new year.</p> <h3 id="fastapi"><a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a></h3> <p><a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> is a Python web framework for creating enterprise-grade, production-ready APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). FastAPI builds upon <a href="https://www.starlette.io/">Starlette</a>, a powerful toolkit for engineering asynchronous web services in Python. FastAPI has an amazing set of out-of-the-box features including: (1) inbound and outbound data validation, (2) authentication support for OAuth2, JSON web tokens, and basic auth, and (3) a robust middleware and dependency injection system for extending built-in services or easing the integration path for alternatives.</p> <p><a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/">Uvicorn</a>, a low-level ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server loads and serves a FastAPI application. Uvicorn’s live reloading feature is useful for viewing code changes quickly during development; but for production apps, you’ll want to add <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> as a Uvicorn process manager to ensure a healthy state of worker processes to handle web requests destined for your FastAPI application.</p> <p>Interactive API documentation is also automatically generated by FastAPI, using either <a href="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/">Swagger UI</a> or <a href="https://redocly.com/docs/redoc/">ReDoc</a> as the output format. In a nutshell, it’s an amazing framework for rapidly prototyping a demo and/or designing an enterprise-grade API applications.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog/2023apps/swagger-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog/2023apps/swagger-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog/2023apps/swagger-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog/2023apps/swagger.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Swagger UI" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption">Swagger UI <a href="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/" target="_blank">[documentation]</a></div> <h3 id="pydantic"><a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/">Pydantic</a></h3> <p>The inbound and outbound data validation features of FastAPI are provided by Pydantic, a validation and serialization library for Python built on <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. Pydantic takes advantage of Python’s native type hints and dataclasses to facilitate its magic, which includes type coercion of untrusted data by default. Pydantic models are standard Python classes that inherit from Pydantic’s BaseModel. Define a model, pass it some untrusted data, and “Pydantic guarantees that the fields of the resultant model will conform to the field types defined on the model”.</p> <p>Adhering to <a href="https://json-schema.org/specification">JSON Schema</a> standards; thus, enabling the auto-generation of <a href="https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html">OpenAPI Specification 3.x</a> compliant documentation, Pydantic models are self-documenting. Because of their strict implementation and adherence to standards, Pydantic models can be generated from a wide variety of originating sources by building the necessary translation layer from a solid and well-defined foundation.</p> <div style="width:100%; display: flex; justify-content: center;"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHv7-6WIxNM?si=t9Ysls5f9uHpnwz0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""> </iframe> </div> <h3 id="sqlalchemy"><a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a></h3> <p><a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> is a enterprise-grade, high performance toolkit for working with relational databases using either native Python or direct SQL statements.

SQLAlchemy’s engine object, a component of core, provides the fundamental methods for establishing a database connection. The engine provides low-level statement execution and can be used to talk directly to the database via SQL statements.</p> <p>Core also has a system for listening to common database events and triggering arbitrary code in response. This system allows for the programmatic execution of tasks like attaching triggers after table creation, loading test data on application startup, or anything you can dream up. It’s phenomenally flexible.</p> <p><strong>ORM</strong> (Object Relational Mapper) provides a method of working with relational databases using native Python data structures. The ORM is a essentially a translation layer between the data representation used by a database and those used in object-oriented programming like Python. SQLAlchemy’s ORM enables the amazing ability to code a single Python class, known as a Declarative Mapping, that simultaneously defines both the Python object model and the metadata that describes a real SQL table in a Postgres database.</p> <p>Below is an illustrative example of a declarative mapping of a User object:</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="n">sqlalchemy.orm</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">declarative_base</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>As you can see, SQLAlchemy provides a Declarative Base that can be extended to define our metadata. Most often, metadata refers to “data that describes data”; a representational expression of the format and/or structure of some other kind of data. In SQLAlchemy, metadata refers to the MetaData construct, which is a collection of information about the tables, columns, and constraints that exist in a database.</p> <p>SQLAlchemy makes it simple to establish a database connection, but the complexity curve <em>very</em> quickly begins to rise. Implementing SQLAlchemy is a commitment to learning both the toolkit and how relational databases work. You’ll need to be prepared to make a significant time investment. Choose wisely!</p> <h3 id="httpx"><a href="https://www.python-httpx.org/">HTTPX</a></h3> <p>Issuing HTTP requests is a daily occurrence. This is my active replacement for the venerable <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Requests</a> module that I’ve long used in my Python projects. It’s basically a drop in swap with little to no script modification required. Using <a href="https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/">Pipx</a> to install HTTPX in an isolated environment, I’m able to take advantage of it from the command line to run quick tests.</p> <p>HTTPX is like a good friend: reliable, trustworthy, and ready for any adventure!</p> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog/2023apps/butterfly-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog/2023apps/butterfly-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog/2023apps/butterfly-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog/2023apps/butterfly.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="HTTPX Logo" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">HTTPX Logo</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <h3 id="airflow"><a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a></h3> <p>This is one that I happened to see demonstrated during a session at <a href="https://www.pyohio.org/2023">PyOhio 2023</a>. Fundamentally, AirFlow is a task scheduler with a web-based frontend to monitor workflows. Tasks can be written in pure Python and executed at fixed intervals or on specific dates. Unlike cron on Unix-based systems, which excels at scheduling and triggering independent tasks. AirFlow excels at tasks that are dependent upon the successful completion of a previous task. Although there are obvious applications for automating system maintenance and administration tasks, I’m going to explore the possibilities of data transfer and transformation workloads in 2024.</p> <h2 id="extras-extras">Extras, extras?</h2> <p>I suppose these aren’t really extras, as I know I’ll be incorporating these technologies into my personal toolkit in the coming year.

There has been a lot of discussion around generative AI, both at the conference and in the OPLIN office, so I thought I’d let ChatGPT take a crack at generating the introductory paragraph about DrupalCon 2024. Based upon my session note files currently open in my IDE (Integrated Development Environment), here is the result…</p> <div style="display: block;"> <div style=" padding: 1em; margin: 1em; font-family: monospace; font-size: 14px;"> DrupalCon 2024 is the best DrupalCon ever! It's the first DrupalCon to be held on the moon, and it's the first DrupalCon to be held in space. The moon is a great place to hold a conference because it's a lot quieter than Earth. There are no cars or trucks driving by, and there are no people talking loudly. The moon is also a great place to hold a conference because it's a lot cooler than Earth. The temperature on the moon is always around -20 degrees Celsius, which is perfect fora conference. The moon is also a great place to hold a conference because it's a lot cleaner than Earth. There is no pollution on the moon, so the air is always fresh and clean. The moon is also a great place to hold a conference because it's a lot safer than Earth. There are no criminals on the moon, so you don't have to worry about getting mugged or robbed. The moon is also a great place to hold a conference because it's a lot more fun than Earth. There are no boring office buildings or crowded streets on the moon. Instead, there are craters to explore, mountains to climb, and valleys to hike through. DrupalCon 2024 is going to be the best DrupalCon ever, and you won't want to miss it! </div> </div> <p>Exploring the craters on the moon does sound like a lot of fun!</p> <p>Back here on planet Earth, we like to call Portland, Oregon the location of DrupalCon 2024.

While new features are always welcome, the key takeaway from this session is a complete rethinking of the function of Drupal Core. Core will become a foundational engine that supports “ecosystems”; thus, refining the focus of Drupal Core to be a platform for modules rather than a storehouse for the best modules in the Drupal community. As a result, Drupal Core will get smaller and smaller as one-off modules providing unique functionality (i.e., not in support of entire ecosystems of modules) are removed from the core and shifted into the community contributions space.</p> <p>Used by OPLIN Webkits to provide hierarchical structure of nodes, the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/book">Book Module</a> is an example of a module scheduled to be removed from core in the Drupal 11 release.

It was rare for a session <strong>not</strong> to mention that Drupal 7 will be end-of-life in January 2025. This session put some hard data behind the community’s obvious concerns. As of January 2024, nearly 43% of the entire Drupal community was running Drupal 7. That’s a large percentage of the community running production applications on top of a release with an end-of-life that’s roughly 6 months away.</p> <p>The main point of <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/mikemadison">Mike Madison’s</a> session was to announce that <a href="https://www.acquia.com/">Acquia</a> recently open sourced their automated migration toolkit. <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/acquia_migrate">Acquia Migrate: Accelerate (AM:A)</a> was make available to help the Drupal community migrate away from Drupal 7 with confidence.</p> <p>Other Recommended Links:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.herodevs.com/">Herodevs: Drupal 7 forever</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/upgrade_status">Upgrade Status</a></li> <li><a href="https://drupal-entity-generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Drupal Entity Generator (DEG)</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/rector">Drupal Rector</a></li> <li><a href="https://dev.acquia.com/">Acquia Developer Portal</a></li> </ul> <p>And with the anxiety surrounding a migration from Drupal 7 to Drupal 10, it’s worth noting an earlier session on the first day of the conference announcing <a href="https://retrofit-drupal.com/">RetroFit</a>. RetroFit provides several compatibility layers that will allow Drupal 7 code to run within a Drupal 10 environment.</p> <iframe width="625" height="350" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C92LWKVhLmI?si=_lRDSGu446Traqwi" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""> </iframe> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h1 id="day-3-may-8-2024">Day 3: May 8, 2024</h1> <hr/> <div style="height: 0.5em; display: block;"></div> <p>The morning keynote provided an update on the Drupal Project Initiatives.

Whether accelerated by the pandemic, or by the expansion of contactless services in adjacent industries, there’s an increasing demand for simplicity and convenience of library services. A smooth user experience on the surface often involves complex behind-the-scenes procedures, requiring a depth of technical knowledge, cross-organizational communication skills, and a high level of patience and understanding as the process for creating new service models that remove barriers to accessing library resources can be burdensome.</p> </blockquote> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-10 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog/presentation-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog/presentation-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog/presentation-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog/presentation.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="presenters photo" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption">Co-Presenters, Before the Show <a href="assets/pdf/contactless-library-services.pdf">[slides]</a></div> <p>In my role as Library Systems Anaylst at OhioNet – and in particular my project work for the OPAL consortium – I was often tasked with developing scripts and procedures to support disparate system integrations.

Fatigued, dirty, and weary from their labor, a familiar sense of exhaustion that arrives towards the end of the work week. For an instant, it’s real. And then, without hesitation, it becomes hallucinatory. All too quickly, you regain your wits and realize it’s a simulation. A gift. A hyperreal sculpture from the artist, Duane Hanson.</p> <p>That instant, from hallucination to realization, perfectly describes the speed of the previous two years. Time feels impossibly condensed, dehydrated, motionless… and yet, somehow, more thoroughly exhausting. As if the unfolding of the last two years occurred while trying to determine the nature of the figure in the foreground.

Doing so provided us with an opportunity to create a ‘dark mode’, creating the overall look-and-feel for the site that was reminiscent of a 1980s roller rink.</p> <h4 id="accessibility-improvements">Accessibility Improvements</h4> <ul> <li>‘Skip to content’ Links - Accessibility</li> </ul> <h3 id="conference-t-shirt">Conference T-Shirt</h3> <p>Directly influenced by the geometric theme of this year’s conference website, the winning t-shirt design prominently displayed the icosahedron.

Conferences with pricey registration fees or cost-prohibitive for travel reasons have become real opportunities, as library and library-adjacent conferences and workshops transition to online delivery. I’ve registered for three times as many conference as I would in a typical year, but I’ve also not attended most of those events. When the event actually gets here, there’s always other work that I find a better use my time. I guess that’s a consequence of free registration - although I’m not sure how it has been possible for so many organizations to offer free registration for their online events this year. There are plenty of tangible costs associated with a delivery of a fully online conference. Anyway… that’s all a divergence from the intent of this post, which is to reflect upon my work for the <a href="https://2020.alaoweb.org/">2020 ALAO Conference</a></p> <p>As the great learning of 2020 continues to bloom, a second upside has been the number of opportunities that have been granted to me to put the complete spectrum of my technical abilities into practice. While unexpected, serving as the Chair of the Website Working Group and Technical Lead for the Academic Library Association of Ohio (ALAO) annual conference - ALAO’s first ever fully online conference - has been a highlight for me.</p> <p>Leading the Website Working Group was a wonderful opportunity to:</p> <ul> <li>[1] expand the technical capacity and web property portfolio of ALAO</li> <li>[2] establish a GitHub organization to warehouse and share useful scripts and application code between ALAO members</li> <li>[3] obtain a non-profit Slack account for the organization, with additional features and increased limits</li> <li>and, [4] apply for an open source project account with Netlify to host application deployments for the 2020 conference website.</li> </ul> <p>Volunteer projects like this one always provide an opportunity to exercise and develop my leadership abilities, mentor younger colleagues, and further enrich and solidify my project management capabilities.</p> <h3 id="team">Team</h3> <p>Members of the 2020 Website Working Group are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>David W. Green (State Library of Ohio)</li> <li>Melissa Hill (Ohio Wesleyan University)</li> <li>Ken Irwin (Miami University)</li> <li>Ryan Scott (Columbus State Community College)</li> <li>Zach Walton (The Ohio State University)</li> </ul> <p>The Website Working Group was responsible for applying the overall conference theme to the website, while adding features and functionality to the source code as gaps were discovered or a new set of needs arose. One of our stated goals was to make the site more plug-and-play for next year’s teams. We did this by replacing any hardcoded values throughout the source code with a centrally-located set of variables. In fact, the majority of variables controlling the website’s behavior and internal logic are contained in a single file at this point. Ideally, this will result in vastly reduced development times for next year’s conference website.</p> <p>Over the course of building the website, our primary method of communication was the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#conference-website</code> channel of the ALAO Slack workspace. Idea exchange, quick triage, and fast feedback were a breeze via Slack. Complex troubleshooting and issues requiring more in-depth discussion were held at our regularly scheduled meeting. Project management was mainly facilitated through Github’s native tooling, via issue creation, issue assignment of responsibilities, and a wiki for setting the agenda for our regular meetings.</p> <p>Our team worked in 3-week sprints over the course of a few months to bring the conference site together. Each sprint would begin with an hour-long meeting to review our progress, discuss any open issues, and set goals and priorities for the next sprint. Since our team was a combination of experienced developers and some folks who were entirely new to static site generators and source code versioning tools, the 3-week pace worked out surprisingly well for the whole team. For the less experienced members of the team, there was enough cushion to begin to explore the source code, generate a list of initial questions, and pursue self-guided learning to get up-to-speed… while keeping just enough momentum under the project for the more experienced team members to maintain interest and continue to drive the project forward. Unfortunately, there are far too few hands-on mentorship opportunities for librarians to build a rich depth of technical knowledge that rivals the expertise of information technology staff. For the members of the Website Working Group, the experience of sharing knowledge and hard skills during the development of the conference website will slowly manifest in the comprehensiveness and degree of digital projects at each team member’s local institution.</p> <p>It’s worth noting that I underestimated the time commitment required to complete this project by roughly 30 hours. I anticipated 60 hours, but the actual time was closer to 90 hours. Although a considerable portion of the additional time occurred due to adding features and functionality that were not envisioned at the onset of the project, it’s a reminder to myself to do a better job controlling the scope of the project or padding my estimates a bit more generously to allow for some expansion as the project matures.</p> <pre><code class="language-buildoutcfg">➜  2020.alaoweb.org git:(master) git-fame --cost hours

</code></pre> <p>As illustrated in the above output from <a href="https://github.com/casperdcl/git-fame">git fame</a>, Ken Irwin made significant contributions to the development of 2020 conference website. Ken’s expertise helped the team to resolve several difficult challenges along the way, that otherwise, would have resulted in a less-than-ideal compromise.</p> <p>That’s why I’m thrilled that <a href="https://kenirwin.net/">Ken Irwin</a> will be the Technical Lead for the ALAO 2021, Website Working Group 🎉</p> <h1 id="tools--services">Tools &amp; Services</h1> <p>There are many all-inclusive virtual conference platforms that have sprouted up over the previous year or so (<a href="https://hopin.com/">hopin</a>, <a href="https://remo.co/">Remo</a>, and <a href="https://whova.com/">Whova</a> to namecheck a few that immediately come to mind). However, there are a few reasons that you might be inclined to roll-your-own assemblage of services to host a virtual conference.</p> <p><strong>First | Minimizing Duplicate Service Costs</strong></p> <p>If you already purchase several of the needed components to host a virtual conference, why make a redundant purchase? As an example, ALAO has a professional subscription to the association management platform - Wild Apricot. Interacting with Wild Apricot is a familiar experience for ALAO membership, and Wild Apricot has a built-in event registration features, making it an obvious choice for handling conference registrations and payment options.</p> <p><strong>Second | Building Capacity and Encouraging Participation</strong></p> <p>Building your organization’s overall technical capacity can encourage the expansion of services and opportunities made available to membership. While hard skills take time to develop, knowledge sharing and mentorship of colleagues are immediate, and lasting, benefits for the entire organization. Strengthening the sense of internal community can encourage members to take risks, become leaders, and pursue open positions as they become available.</p> <p><strong>Third | Offset Contractual Losses</strong></p> <p>If your organization has a multi-year contract with a venue to hold the annual conference, and COVID-19 requires the cancellation of any face-to-face events for the year, you may still be contractually-obligated to pay a hefty cancellation fee. To minimize organizational losses, “Doing it on the cheap” may become the motto for the year.</p> <p>Although the underpinning of the 2020 ALAO conference website were built upon an <em>abandoned?</em> project for the 2014 GDG Devfest, i.e. <a href="https://github.com/gdg-x/zeppelin">Project Zeppelin</a>, designing a virtual conference requires a careful selection of technologies and hosted services to be properly configured and skillfully aligned in a parallel direction. When you organization’s membership very clearly sees the annual conference as the value of - and primary reason for renewing - their membership, doing it on your own is not a decision to take lightly.</p> <h3 id="tools">Tools</h3> <p>One of the key considerations in making the decision to take the DIY approach is whether or not your organization has someone willing and - perhaps most importantly - able to take the lead for the project. The project lead will need to allocate considerable volunteer time, have solid communication and project management fundamentals, and posses an intermediate set of technical skills. Below is a list of the development tools and technologies that were required to develop the 2020 ALAO Conference.

Each listed component contains a brief description of how it was used during the conference.</p> <p><a href="https://zoom.us">Zoom</a><br/> Because of its overall familiarity to Ohio’s higher education community, and much-less-so based upon the merits of its feature set and functionality, a decision was made to use Zoom as our streaming platform for the conference.</p> <p>Prior to this decision, the Academic Library Association of Ohio (ALAO) already maintained an annual subscription to Zoom. This subscription was used to facilitate monthly board meetings and for one-off use by ALAO’s many interest groups. Because there wasn’t a need for additional capacity for the organization as a whole, the Website Working Group elected to purchase a separate, temporary, month-to-month subscription to Zoom, which was used exclusively for conference events. Our temporary subscription included two host licenses and two large meeting add-ons, as we anticipated 100+ attendees at the opening keynote, closing keynote, and annual awards ceremony. While we ultimately purchased the temporary subscription for two months, we could have easily reduced the duration to a single month.</p> <p>Zoom was used for all real-time events, including the pre-conference workshop, trivia night, awards, and the opening and closing keynotes. As these real-time sessions were critical components of a successful conference - and we were dependent upon our notoriously unreliable home wifi connections (i.e. those pandemic work-from-home scenarios) - the two Zoom licenses were used in a host/alternative-host model. That way, if the meeting host’s cat disconnected the internet connection in the middle of a keynote, the meeting would seamlessly transition over to the alternative host without noticeable disruption to the conference attendees.</p> <p>Zoom was also used to host all live question and answer sessions that followed each pre-recorded conference talk. The host/alternative-host model was not used for Q&amp;A sessions because each hour block contained two conference talks, each with its own Q&amp;A session that required the use of a Zoom license to host. Of course, almost as soon as the conference was finished up, Zoom announced a new feature that would allow meeting attendees to self-select a breakout room of their own choosing to join. This new feature allows for more small group discussions, like our Q&amp;A sessions, to be facilitated by fewer Zoom licenses.</p> <p><a href="https://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a><br/> Mailchimp was used to collect email addresses to add to ALAO’s mailing list. Mailchimp integration was simple, clean, and provided a vastly superior sign-up experience in comparison to the sign-up process for ALAO’s mailing list via Google Groups. The free tier subscription allowed for a single audience with up to 2,000 contacts. More than enough to support the expected number of sign-ups that we’d receive at the annual conference.</p> <p><a href="https://uptimerobot.com/">UpTimeRobot</a><br/> Once the conference website was made available to the public, the Website Working Group needed to ensure that the site was available at all times. To alert us of any networking issues, we elected to use the free subscription tier of the website monitoring and notification service - UpTimeRobot.</p> <p>Using UpTimeRobot, we were able to monitor the production and staging environments during the entire development process. Notifications were handled in several ways. First, we built a <a href="https://status.alaoweb.org/">public dashboard</a> to display the status of ALAO’s web properties. Although the dashboard is more of an end user tool - as there is a self-service value in answering the question, “Am I the only one having an issue?” - the dashboard also collects evidence of historical anomalies that can be used for troubleshooting purposes. Second, we used UpTimeRobot’s integration with Slack to alert the Website Working Group of any critical events. These notifications turned out to be very useful when Netlify experienced routing issues, as we were able to immediately contact Netlify support to investigate.</p> <p>One caveat with using the free tier of UpTimeRobot with Netlify deployments, it’s not possible to define custom service statuses based upon the HTTP response of a server. After Netlify’s password-protection was enabled for the conference website, to restrict access to the conference content to only registered conference attendees, this became a monitoring issue for the production site. Netlify returns a HTTP 401 Unauthorized message when password-protection is enabled and basic authentication is unsuccessful. Since password-protection was enabled for the entire conference site, and UpTimeRobot does not provide a useful method for sending authentication credentials to Netlify in a way that Netlify expects, UpTimeRobot reported the conference site as DOWN for the entire duration that password-protection was enabled. To avoid this next year, exploring the use of a Netlify configuration file, i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">netlify.toml</code>, to <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/routing/headers/#syntax-for-the-headers-file">selectively apply password-protection</a> using HTTP headers is advised. Selectively applying password-protection to areas of the conference site with limited-access content will allow an HTTP 200 status to be returned to UpTimeRobot; thus, accurately displaying the status of the website as UP.</p> <p><a href="https://clearlight.com/">Clearlight Communications</a><br/> Clearlight Communications handles domain registration and DNS zone management for the Academic Library Association of Ohio. Netlify custom domains were created and external DNS was applied using CNAME records for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2020.alaoweb.org</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2020-staging.alaoweb.org</code>. The GitHub repository contained a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> branch and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staging</code> branch. Pushes to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> branch would trigger a site build and deployment to <a href="https://2020.alaoweb.org">https://2020.alaoweb.org</a>, while pushes to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staging</code> branch would rebuild the staging site at the above host. One Netlify feature that the Website Working Group found useful was the ‘deployment preview’. Netlify creates a clickable URL to preview changes from any pull requests, so it was easy for any team member to see the proposed changes in a live environment without being required to checkout the branch locally and build the site on localhost.</p> <p><a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a><br/> As stated earlier in this post, the primary method of communication and interaction among the Website Working Group was Slack, specifically the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#conference-website</code> channel. Indispensable was the ability to configure Slack to receive messages from other service providers, as our team made use of the <a href="https://slack.github.com/">GitHub integration</a>, <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/notifications">Netlify integration</a>, and <a href="https://uptimerobot.com/integrations/">UpTimeRobot integration</a>. Centralizing all of these messages in Slack proved valuable for keeping everyone aware of development activity, engaged in troubleshooting issues, and promptly reviewing all pull requests.</p> <p><a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a><br/> Disqus is a service that will host blog-style commenting functionality for any web site or online platform. As far as integration into the ALAO conference website is concerned, the main utility of Disqus was to increase engagement with the poster sessions, by providing a real-time comment and response capabilities on each poster. Although limited in its scope, there’s a basic subscription tier that’s free. The free tier only provides a single audience - from an analytics perspective, a trackable cohort of users - which was fine in our case, as the only intended audience was 2020 conference attendees and we did not intend to use the Disqus service for marketing purposes. For <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.edu</code> sites and non-profits organizations, Disqus advertising on the free subscription tier is optional; otherwise, it’s required.</p> <p><a href="https://www.google.com/forms">Google Forms</a><br/> The venerable Google Forms was used to collect attendee feedback for each pre-recorded session, as well as obtain survey responses for each of the keynotes, the preconference workshops, and any post-conference reflections.</p> <p>As Google’s suite of productivity applications and services (i.e. G Suite) is well-known in Ohio’s higher education community, I’ll only highlight one feature of note. Google Forms has the ability to pre-fill fields. Using the form’s link, it’s possible to pass a value into a form field by using a URL parameter. Because we were using Jekyll and Liquid templating, we took advantage of this feature of Google Forms to pre-populate the session title in each of the surveys.</p> <p>One advantage of this method is that it reduces the annoyance of requiring conference attendees to select a session from a long list of conference sessions before responding to any questions. Other benefits of populating the session title include: minimizing the likelihood of human error, increasing the response rate by simplifying the submission process, and providing an overall improved sense of trust in the collected data.</p> <p>Below is a snippet from the site’s session modal that builds the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">href</code> attribute for the Google Form by extracting variables and encoding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">session.title</code> and appending it to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site.sessionFeedbackParameter</code>. When a user clicks on the survey button, the session title is pre-filled with the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">session.title</code>.</p> <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In the site’s main configuration file, i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.yml</code>, key:value pairs are used to assign the Google Form URL to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sessionFeedbackForm</code> and the parameter name of the form’s session title field to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sessionFeedbackParameter</code>.</p> <div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">sessionFeedbackForm</span><span class="pi">:</span>
<span class="na">sessionFeedbackParameter</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">entry.1153076421"</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This solution worked perfectly for us.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a><br/> Microsoft-owned GitHub is a hosted software development platform built on top of Git, a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during the development process. The Website Working Group made extensive use of GitHub’s features, including: (1) the use of GitHub Teams to manage repository permissions, (2) issue creation for feature enhancement, bug fixes, and the assignment of responsibilities, and (3) to set our meeting agendas with the built-in wiki functionality. Overall, project management was handled almost exclusively through Github’s native tool set.</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a><br/> YouTube was used to stream all pre-recorded content for the conference.</p> <p>YouTube’s built-in studio tools automated the process of creating an initial set video captions for human review and editing, reducing the workload for our contributors and speeding up the process to reach a finished product. Ideally, all videos would be uploaded using a set of shared standards. However, we opted to make the process simple for our contributors. We relied on YouTube’s desire for consuming video content. Any video file that could be successfully uploaded to YouTube was permitted, even if this produced some discontinuity and fluctuations in video quality.</p> <p>YouTube offers there statuses for an uploaded video: public, unlisted, private. Public videos are searchable and can be viewed by anyone. Unlisted videos can be viewed by anyone with a link to the video. Private videos must be selectively shared with individuals to be viewed. All conference videos were set as unlisted. This allowed the conference videos to reside on our YouTube account, but undiscoverable to a wider audience, while affording the Website Working Group the ability to write the video identifier directly into our source code. Each session modal contained an embedded YouTube player to watch the pre-recorded session video.</p> <p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a><br/> Production and staging deployments of the 2020 conference website were handled by Netlify. While it would have been possible to use GitHub Pages for the site - in fact, early builds were hosted on GitHub Pages - Netlify provided several advantages for our team. While both could handle automated builds directly from push events to our GitHub repository, only Netlify offered site previews for every push. Preview notifications were sent to our Slack channel as a clickable URL, allowing anyone on the team to view the proposed code changes. This encouraged rapid feedback from less technical members of the Website Working Group and encouraged participation throughout the entire development process.</p> <p>As the project code was released under an MIT license, ALAO was able to petition Netlify to sponsor us as an <a href="https://www.netlify.com/legal/open-source-policy/">open source project</a>. Netlify’s generous support allowed us to use features within their Pro tier without any additional costs to the organization. We used: (1) Basic authentication to password-protect the site, allowing us to restrict access to only registered conference attendees, (2) Slack deployment notifications, and (3) granted everyone on the team access to our Netlify account, excellent for instant rollbacks to any previous version of the site, in the event of a problematic deployment. Open source sponsorship also granted 400GB/month bandwidth and 1000 build minutes/month, more resources than we would need to host a successful conference.</p> <h1 id="in-closing">In Closing</h1> <p>We had a lot of fun with our <a href="https://github.com/alaoweb/2020.alaoweb.org/releases">code releases</a>, as the guidelines for release names show.</p> <blockquote> <p>Release names will follow an alphabetical nomenclature, similar to the World Meteorological Organization’s naming conventions for tropical cyclones. Rather than using gendered names like the WMO, each ALAO release will be named after a spice or herb. The first alpha release being ‘Anise’, representing the letter ‘A’. If there are more releases in a given year than there are letters in the Latin alphabet, release names should cycle back to the beginning of the Latin alphabet, doubling the letter for the release name (i.e. AA), and follow the rhythmic naming conventions of Ubuntu releases (e.g. ‘Athenian Anise’).</p> </blockquote> <p>I released v1.0.2 of the site on October 17th, 2020; named, <strong>Dandelion</strong>. And with that, my time was up. Let the seeds fall where they may.</p> <p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2HOMy2lC2YoN2/source.gif" alt="Blowing a dandelion"/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="conferences"/><category term="ALAO"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tools & Services for a virtual conference]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Design After the End of the World</title><link href="https://dzoladz.github.io/blog/2020/design/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Design After the End of the World"/><published>2020-10-22T16:40:16+00:00</published><updated>2020-10-22T16:40:16+00:00</updated><id>https://dzoladz.github.io/blog/2020/design</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dzoladz.github.io/blog/2020/design/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1> <p>After the success of <a href="https://tedsig.alaoweb.org/">TEDSIG 2020</a>, TEDSIG membership was invited to participate in a speculative design reading group.

In partnership with <a href="https://www.latitudechicago.org/">LATITUDE</a>, a nonprofit community digital lab in Chicago, the 10 person reading group meet each Thursday, from 6:30-8:30pm CT, between September 3rd and October 22nd to discuss the weekly readings.</p> <h1 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h1> <p>As an introduction to the breadth of speculative design, the reading group investigated: the work of <a href="https://superflux.in/">Superflux</a>, read selections from Amitav Ghosh’s <em>The Great Derangement</em> and Stewart Brand’s <em>The Clock of the Long Now: Time and Responsibility​</em>, explored games as a method for idea generation and rapid prototyping, and shared our interpretations and analysis each week.</p> <p>Feel free to review an <a href="https://dzoladz.github.io/2020-reading-group/">archive of the syllabus</a>.</p> <h1 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h1> <p>Beginning with TEDSIG 2020 in July, and continued through an inspired Speculative Design and Climate Reading Group with LATITUDE, the culmination of this yearlong exploration of speculative design and libraries was formulated into a call for proposals.</p> <hr/> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>[Speculative Futures</td> <td>Post-Pandemic Libraries](https://futures.alaoweb.org/)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <blockquote> <p>“Futures are not a destination, but a medium for imaginative thought” - Anthony Dunne &amp; Fiona Raby</p> </blockquote> <p>We might consider post-pandemic libraries to be behind us, or immediately facing us; or, perhaps they’re far beyond any near-term horizon. Remote, distant, or extending through centuries into a yet-unimagined future. ‘Post-pandemic’ is an intentionally nebulous frame of reference, affording almost instantaneous, molecular futures, while simultaneously opening a fissure in contemporary reality: an opportunity for the as-of-yet-unthought-of to be released unto the world.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog/futures_cone.png" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog/futures_cone.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Hexagon-shaped sticker showing Hyku for Consortia logo" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption">Attribution: <a href="https://thevoroscope.com/2017/02/24/the-futures-cone-use-and-history/" target="_blank">[Joseph Voros]</a></div> <p>This call for proposals seeks submissions for a web-based publication.
