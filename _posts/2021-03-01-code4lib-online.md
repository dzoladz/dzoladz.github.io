Our charge, for the 2021 Website Working Group, was to focus on content strategy and new feature implementations for the first fully-online Code4Lib conference; and our primary goal was straightforward: "To improve the overall experience for users (e.g., all attendees, speakers, potential sponsors, post-conference users)"

### Major Contributions

There's a lot of routine maintenance and general updating that occurs as a conference website moves through several 
phases (pre-conference, peri-conference, post-conference). Each phase having its own utility, purpose, and distinct 
set of dominant functions. And yet, at the end of the 2021 Website Working Group's efforts, there are three areas of 
focused improvements to highlight.

#### Design Page

#### Dark Mode

With the 2021 conference being fully online and remote, we didn't have the host city's skyline to guide the tone and 
choice of colors for the theme. During our initial we attempted to retain a sense of place by proposing the use of a 
fictional city, but eventually settled on a vibrant pastel palette with geometric design. Doing so provided us with 
an opportunity to create a 'dark mode', creating the overall look-and-feel for the site that was reminiscent of a 
1980s roller rink.

#### Accessibility Improvements

### Conference T-Shirt
Directly influenced by the geometric theme of this year's conference website, the winning t-shirt design prominently 
displayed the icosahedron. It's a surprisingly clean and minimal design that distills the spirit of the 2021 conference.
