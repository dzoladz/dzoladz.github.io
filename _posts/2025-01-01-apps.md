The previous year has brought an increased focus on the Python programming language. In particular, web frameworks and 
libraries using to facilitate full-stack application development. My day-to-day activities at OPLIN (Ohio Public 
Library Information Network) involve the creation, maintenance, and implementation of new features for a suite of 
custom applications that enable OPLIN's internal workflows and processes in support of Ohio's 251 public libraries. 

Here's a set of applications that I'm excited to take with me into the new year.

### [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/)

Virtualization on Dell PowerEdge R520
Moving all of the applications running on Raspberry Pis to VMs running on top of ProxMox hypervisor

### [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

Django

Ninja(https://django-ninja.dev/)
Django Ninja https://django-ninja.dev/

### [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/)

Drupal -
https://new.drupal.org/home

Specifically, I'll be exploring Drupal CMS.

Library -> a collection of modules

package -> a unit of distribution (libraries, modules, binaries)

framework -> a set of libraries
provides an architecture, a designed pattern, or offers you a basic flow of how you will develop your program.

This command line tool for managing virtual environments and Python version has been an absolute game changer. I've been using Poetry to manage my Python environments and dependencies for the last 5 years, but uv eliminated the some of the challenges that I was experiencing building dependencies. Uv provides functionality similar to pipx, i.e., isolated environments for executing Python applications, and the interface for interacting with uv is intuitive. It will replace several command line tools in my daily toolbox.
