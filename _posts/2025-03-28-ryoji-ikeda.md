"Scientia sine arte nihil est" - Grohmann Museum

“Scientia sine arte nihl est" - "Science Without Art is Nothing”. An important foundation of the Grohmann Museum and its relationship with the Milwaukee School of Engineering, this phrase is displayed in both Latin on the front and English on the back. This unisex t-shirt is available in black and grey and is made from 100% pre-shrunk cotton.

## Ryoji Ikeda

[https://www.ryojiikeda.com/](https://www.ryojiikeda.com/)

Ryoji Ikeda is clearly in the realm of the digital. Bits and bytes, zeros and ones, discrete, not continuous, samples.
Information is communitcated as discontinuous samples. Points in time that the viewer must reconstruct into a whole.
This is the realm of the digital. 

topographic maps, amplitude visualizations, brain ct, security camera aesthetics, audio rendering, schematic diagrams,
circuit board outlines, spreadsheets, compression, skeletal x-ray, invisalign technology?
intraoral scanning, Point clouds, computed tomography, printed circuit board (PCB)

crisp, cold, precise. Compressions, digitization, 

speed = instant

Should I discuss the auditory components?


"Japan’s leading electronic composer and visual artist Ryoji Ikeda focuses on the essential characteristics of sound itself and that of visuals as light by means of both mathematical precision and mathematical aesthetics."

surreal, mechanical, 

speed = slow

rotating mechanical armatures and **synchronized** strobe lights, there's a protocol that must be adhered to

Employing the 19th-century theory of the persistence of vision

auditory components?

"Human consciousness... rather slow, (15 to 20 bits per second), plodding way it is capable of remarkable feats of reason."
"In a darkened room I present sequentially formed sculptures on a rapidly spinning armature. A synchronized strobe light supplies the illumination. The images exist in real time and viewers are able to share the same space with them. The illusion creates a conflict between sensory information and logic which suggests the reality of a dream. One by one images or “gestalts” are knit together into a coherent (or incoherent) whole."
